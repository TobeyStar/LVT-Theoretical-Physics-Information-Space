## 🌌 Overview
Locational Variable Theory (LVT) is an axiomatic field theory that operationalizes macroscopic spacetime as an emergent property of underlying quantum informational complexity. By redefining location ($LV$) as a node-pointer in a discrete informational graph, LVT provides a unified solution to the most persistent anomalies in modern physics.

### **Key Breakthroughs**
* **Gravity without Spacetime:** The informational discharge triggered by locational imbalance within the cosmic matrix, functioning as a thermodynamic restoration of equilibrium.
* **The Friction Anomaly:** Explained via **Landauer’s Principle** as the thermal exhaust of chaotic data erasure during microscopic interaction.
* **Non-Kinetic Propulsion:** The theoretical and engineering basis for the **Nilsson-Drive**, allowing for spatial translation without traversing the intervening metric ($C \cdot O < T_{\mathrm{local}}$).
* **The Uniqueness Principle:** A new derivation of the Pauli Exclusion Principle as an "IP-address conflict" in reality’s rendering engine.

## 🔬 The Falsification Experiment: The Ping-Pong Protocol
LVT is a scientific theory, not a philosophy. It offers a high-precision, testable prediction: If a quantum state is successfully isolated ($O \to 0$) and its address rewritten ($LV_A \to LV_B$), it will bypass the intervening spatial metric entirely. 

The measurement of **Zero-Scattering** in the proposed ion-trap experiment will constitute a definitive confirmation of the informational paradigm.

## 🛠 Contributing & Peer Review
We invite physicists, mathematicians, and engineers to:
1.  **Review the Formalism:** Critique the mathematical derivations in DOC00.
2.  **Audit the Engineering:** Analyze the QEC and reactor safety protocols in Phase 3.
3.  **Collaborate on Experiments:** We are actively seeking laboratory teams with ion-trap capabilities to execute the Ping-Pong Protocol.
