# LVT-Theoretical-Physics-Information-Space
An axiomatic field theory redefining spacetime as an emergent informational matrix. Includes the complete 12-document framework, LaTeX source, and the Ping-Pong experimental protocol.

Overview
​Locational Variable Theory (LVT) posits that the universe is not a continuous physical container, but a discrete informational network. What we perceive as "distance" and "spacetime" are emergent properties of node-pointer relations within the cosmic source code.
​Why LVT Matters
​This framework provides novel, testable solutions to the most significant "dead ends" in modern physics:
​Gravity without Spacetime: Derived from the thermodynamic cost of informational cleanup.
​The Friction Anomaly: Explained via Landauer’s Principle as the exhaust of chaotic data erasure.
​Non-Kinetic Propulsion: The theoretical basis for the Nilsson-Drive, allowing for spatial translation without traversing the intervening metric.
​The Uniqueness Principle: A new derivation of the Pauli Exclusion Principle as an "IP-address conflict" in reality’s rendering engine.
​The Falsification Experiment: The Ping-Pong Protocol
​Unlike many "Theories of Everything," LVT is falsifiable. Document 5 outlines a high-precision experiment using a ^{171}\text{Yb}^+ ion trap to demonstrate Zero-Scattering translation. If confirmed, it proves that space is a render, not a constant.
